# CodeQuiz

The objective of this assignment was to create a quiz that would have a decrementing timer, a score that increases with correct answers, and changes the questions after the user answers them. 
I got a lot of practice with conditional statements, functions, and arrays. I also worked with scope in terms of defining variables and utilizing them in functions.
